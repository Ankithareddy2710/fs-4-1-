Mr Ajay Sharma is working woth words.
He found that few words in the langugage have same meaning.
Such words are given as a list of pairs as mappedpairs[],
where mappedpairs[i] = [word1, word2] indicates that word1 and word2 are 
the words with same meaning.

He is given phrase, and he wants to apply all the mappedpairs[] on the phrase.

Your task is to help Mr.Ajay Sharma to find and return all possible 
Mapped Phrases generated after applying all the mapped words,
and print them in lexicographical order.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N, number of mapped pairs.
Next N lines: Two space separated words, mappedpair[].
Last Line: A line of words, the phrase.

--------------
Print the list of mapped phrases in sorted order.

There are N persons in a Instagram Page, the persons are identified by a 
unique identification number from 0 to N-1. There may exist a strange person 
in the IG page.

The rules to identify the strange person X are:
    - Everyone in the IG Page follows the person X.
    - X does not follow anybody in that IG Page.

You are given a N*N matrix IG[][] representing the followers in the IG Page,
the matrix contains only 0's and 1's. 0 indicates "not follows", 
1 indicates "follows". Your task is to find the strange person X among 
the N people. You are allowed to perform only one operation:
    - You can check whether M follows N, if yes, means M follows N.
    But it won't guarantee that N follows M.

You can perform this operation as less as possible to find the strange person X.

If you found a strange person X, print the identification number of X,
Otherwise, print '-1'

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1 : An integer N, number of persons
Next N lines : N space separated integers.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, the UIN or '-1'
